.SH NAME
.PP
jx\-pipeline\-convert\-remotetasks \- Converts the pipelines to use native Tekton syntax


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBjx\-pipeline convert remotetasks\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Converts the pipelines from the 'image: uses:sourceURI' mechanism to native Tekton.

.PP
Existing PipelineRuns are converted into either a new PipelineRun, that uses the Tekton git resolver to pull tasks from the sourceURI, or to explicit Tasks based on whether existing PipelineRun has a parent in it's in it's stepTemplate.

.PP
Existing Tasks have the default lighthouse params/envVars (PULL NUMBER, REPO NAME etc) appended to them.

.PP
As existing steps are being migrated to tasks a workspace volume needs to be mounted to the tasks. By default the size of the workspace is calculated based on the size of the repository + a 300Mi buffer. This can be overridden by setting \-\-calculate\-workspace\-volume=false \& \-\-workspace\-volume= <size>(if no value is given it defaults to 1Gi)


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-batch\-mode\fP[=false]
    Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input

.PP
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-calculate\-workspace\-volume\fP[=true]
    Calculate the workspace volume size based on the size of the repository + a 300Mi buffer. This will override the value set in \-\-workspace\-volume

.PP
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-dir\fP="."
    The directory to look for the pipeline files. Defaults to the current directory

.PP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP[=false]
    help for remotetasks

.PP
\fB\-\-log\-level\fP=""
    Sets the logging level. If not specified defaults to $JX\_LOG\_LEVEL

.PP
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-sha\fP=""
    Overrides the SHA taken from "image:uses:" with the given value

.PP
\fB\-\-verbose\fP[=false]
    Enables verbose output. The environment variable JX\_LOG\_LEVEL has precedence over this flag and allows setting the logging level to any value of: panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace

.PP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-workspace\-volume\fP=""
    The size of the workspace volume that backs the pipelines.
